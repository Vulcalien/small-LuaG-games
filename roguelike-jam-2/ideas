Jam genre: Roguelike
Jam Theme: Web

In this game, the player is an antivirus that goes around the *Web* killing
viruses in many websites.

To make the game roguelike, each website could have different files.
The file names are randomly choosen from a name pool or something.

Then each file is connected to a few other files.
Implementation detail: using a tree seems the best way, generated using a
recursive algorithm.

So we have levels (websites) and rooms (files).

The room view should be like the one in old Pokemon/Legend of Zelda games,
so that the player has 4 directions.

Inside rooms there should be interesting items, obstacles, a few enemies,
sometimes a boss (maybe in the last room).

The player should have: an inventory (unlimited or not?), an armor slot,
weapon slot, shield slot?, boots slot?

Items should be antivirus-related or biological virus related (because funny).

Stats? Maybe increase damage, hp, attack cooldown? and similar by drinking
"potions" (or the antivirus version of potions, e.g. upgrades, cpu cores,
ram...)

# Ideas for enemies
- Worm: goes underground and gets out only to attack the player.
- Trojan: a wooden horse that when exploding releases smaller troops.
- Spyware: a big eye that fires a laser at the player.
- Simple virus: attacks the player, then retreats to reproduce.
